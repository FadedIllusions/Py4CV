This repo houses an exhibition of the skills I acquired via Adrian Rosebrock's book entitled "Practical Python and OpenCV".

Adrian can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ .

His book, "Practical Python and OpenCV" can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/practical-python-opencv/ .

I highly recommend any and all of Adrian's books for those new in the field or wanting to delve deeper and have a better understanding of the concepts.
